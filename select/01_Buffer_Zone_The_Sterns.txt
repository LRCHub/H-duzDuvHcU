I observed you from the train today
You and all of your disciples
Roll call, set up shop, just who will stay?
Who will run the errands, buy supplies
Take those little whores by surprise?

As I step outside the train today
Creeping slowly towards the market
Pamphlets, baby dolls, "please sir, don't stray"
I can take your name, are you a queer? No?
How about you volunteer?

As the girl storms inside
Self-proclaimed saviors tried and failed
Three young men with great pride
They were armed and behind they trailed
As the lab coat emerged, her remarks were sweet and short
Please leave us alone, we can fight it out in court

You'll take pictures from a taxicab
As you canvas my old high school
Roll call, set up shop, just what to say?
That girl smoking in her wheelchair
We don't need to save her today

You'll place posters in the buffer zone
Just beside the baseball diamond
Hero students lobbing tennis balls
Oh, duck and cover, don't you worry
Christian teachers take your battles to the hallowed halls

As the girl storms inside
Self-proclaimed saviors tried and failed
Three young men with great pride
Now unarmed and behind they trail
The headmaster emerged, he was armed with his retort
Please leave these kids alone, we can fight it out in court
Please leave these kids alone, we can fight it out in court
Please leave these kids alone, we can fight it out in court
Please leave
